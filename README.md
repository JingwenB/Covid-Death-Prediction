# Covid-Death-Prediction

This is an academic project for UBC Machine Learning 2020 WT1 (Oct 2020). 
The project takes place on Kaggle. We scored at **2nd** place in the second phase. 

## problem description

The competition was proceeded in two phases. In the first phase competition
we are provided with an initial training dataset dataset consisting of 4 different Covid-19-related counts
for effectively all countries in the world for all days starting from Dec. 31st, 2019 up to Oct. 5th, 2020. 
In the first ohase, we are using data from Dec. 31st, 2019 up to Oct. 5th, 2020 to provid Canadian daily Covid-19 death totals for the days Oct. 6-16th,
2020. 

In the second phase competition, we are provided with a second training dataset that runs up to the 25th of Oct(on Oct 25th). We needed to run the mode 
we built before on the new dataset, to predict Canadian daily Covid-19 death totals for the days Oct. 6-16th,
2020.
